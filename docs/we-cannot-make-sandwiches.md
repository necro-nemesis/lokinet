# What Lokinet can't do 

Lokinet does a few things very well, but obviously can't do everything.

## Anonymize OS/Application Fingerprints

Mitigating OS/Application Fingerprinting is the responsibility of the OS and Applications. Lokinet is an Unspoofable IP Packet Onion router, tuning OS fingerprints to be uniform would be a great thing to have in general even outside of the context of Lokinet. The creation of such an OS bundle is a great idea, but outside the scope of Lokinet. We welcome others to develop a solution for this.

## Malware

Lokinet cannot prevent running of malicious programs. Computer security unfortunately cannot be solved unilaterally by networking software without simply dropping all incoming and outgoing traffic.

## Phoning Home

Lokinet cannot prevent software which sends arbitrary usage data or private information to Microsoft/Apple/Google/Amazon/Facebook/etc. If you are using a service that requires the ability to phone home in order to work, that is a price you pay to use that service.

## Make Sandwiches

At its core, Lokinet is technology that anonymizes and authenticates IP traffic. At this current time Lokinet cannot make you a sandwich. No, not even as root.
